# kamel
The IMAP library for Kotlin.

## Name
Kamel is German for camel.
The original name was K-Mail (for Kotlin Mail), but
to avoid confusion with KMail (the KDE mail client) or
K9-Mail (the Android mail client), I renamed it to the
similar-sounding Kamel.

# How to use
1. Include the library in your Gradle build file (wait for the first release)
2. Just look at the code, real docs are coming soon (whereas soon can really mean anything from days to years)
